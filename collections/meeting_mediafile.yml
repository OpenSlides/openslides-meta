  description: Calculated in actions. Shows what access group permissions are actually relevant. Calculated as the intersection of this meeting_mediafiles access_group_ids and the related mediafiles potential parent mediafiles inherited_access_group_ids. If the parent has no meeting_mediafile for this meeting, its inherited access group is assumed to be the meetings admin group. If there is no parent, the inherited_access_group_ids is equal to the access_group_ids. If the access_group_ids are empty, the interpretations is that every group has access rights, therefore the parent inherited_access_group_ids are used as-is.
