# A projection is an M2M model between a projector and an element which is assigned to it.
# It can either be the current projection, a preview or a history projection (i.e. previously
# projected, with reference retained for protocolling purposes). The projection can only be
# connected to the projector once in one of these contexts. Projections are projector- and
# element-specific, meaning that, while the type of projector reference may change, neither
# the referenced projector, nor the content_object of the projection may be changed.
